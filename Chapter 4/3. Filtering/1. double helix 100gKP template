#In order to filter variants as shown in Chapter 4, Figure 4.1 on the 100gKP double helix super computer I used a general template and interchanged the basic code for each task. Below is an example. If you cat all the annotated files together you don't have to use FILE_ID=$(sed -n "${LSB_JOBINDEX}p" "$IDs_file") but this makes the file very big.

#BSUB -q short  # depending on the number of files that you will need
#BSUB -P re_gecip_cancer_colorectal # edit this line
#BSUB -o %J.stdout
#BSUB -e %J.stderr
#BSUB -J "duplicateposcolumn[1-143]%143"
#BSUB -cwd .
#BSUB -n 1 # this will need to be the same as the number of VEP forks
#BSUB -R "rusage[mem=64000] span[hosts=1]"
#BSUB -M 64000

#For each filtering option that included a word, I changed the CHROM_PASS file name and contents to match; for example: to filter for only HIGH and MODERATE impact variants I made a file called CHROM_HIGH_MODERATE, which contained:

CHROM
HIGH 
MODERATE

#Which can then be used as the input file for grep -wf. 

#The template for submitting to the supercomputer stayed the same with alternative lines of codes used for the different filtering steps using.
